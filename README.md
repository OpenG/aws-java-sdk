# AWS SDK for Java 8

AWS (Amazon Web Services) SDK (Software Development Kit) for Java 8.

This project is an attempt to create a set of AWS SDK libraries and Test utilities to make AWS adoption easier. Though
since evey single bit of code is currently developed on as needed basis, it might lack some of the functionality but it
should grow as time passes and since all the code is basically being written for production use, the bugs will be
squashed with the least possible delay.
